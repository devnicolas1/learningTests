# Learning Tests

*My first experience with tests, using PHPUnit*
---

Unit testing is the idea of breaking your application into the simplest pieces possible, and then, test it individually, to make sure it all works as inteded. This is what I did with the classes contained into this repository (User and UserTest). You can check the `src` folder to see the origin classes, and the `tests` to see the test classes and all the methods from PHPUnit that I used.

This repository will most likely be updated with more tests, methods and ideas as time goes on.
